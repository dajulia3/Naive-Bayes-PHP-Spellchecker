Naive-Bayes-PHP-Spellchecker
============================

A cute little project that implements a naive bayes classifier to do spell checking based on frequency of words in Moby Dick. Does it all in-memory each time because I was too lazy to use a database since this was just a "proof of concept". I suppose I could bundle it with a SQLite database if I get around to it. I'd like it to remain a self-contained project with no setup involved so I probably will not have it use any other kind of db that requires setup. Also, some current "slang" and other more modern words that don't appear in Moby Dick will be flagged as spelling errors. This is not a "problem" with the Naive Baye's classifier, it just means that it needs more data! It could easily be extended to parse more books. Currently, it uses edit distance 1, edit distance 2, deletes, and swap distance 1 to determine possible word choices. This spell checker not only suggests valid words when you type a word not in the dictionary, but also suggests other valid words you could have meant when you type in a valid word.
